iOS GUI library inspired by [MonoTouch.Dialog](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/MonoTouch.Dialog)

I stopped working on this library.  Two days after I put this on Github I read about [QuickDialog](https://github.com/escoz/QuickDialog).  It doesn't make sense for me to develop CocoaTouchDialog any further.  If you need a solid library for UITableView-based interface for iOS check out [QuickDialog](https://github.com/escoz/QuickDialog).

Thanks.
